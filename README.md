# Kickstarter Analysis
**Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Data**

  ## Overview of Project
  The purpose of this project is to analyse, visualise and elaborate the performance of Louise's different fund raising campaigns with respect to their lunch dates and campaign goals. Excel pivot tables and pivot graphs will be used to carry out this analysis.

  ## Analysis and Challenges
  In this project, we will be carrying out two different analysis for Louise's theater campaign category.
  Firstly, we will analyse the theater outcomes based on launch date between January to December. We will then analyse the theater outcomes based on launch goals, categorised from amounts less than $1000 to amounts more than $50000. This analysis is defined below as:
   + Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
   + Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

   ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
   The graph below shows the analysis of theater outcomes based on launch date.

   In this section, campaign data for January to December are grouped into Successful, failed and canceled categories for the theater category. This is then plotted on a line graph to show the trends accross the various months. Based on the above analysis, we will be able to determine the months with the maximum and minimum success, failure or cancellation. We will also be able to visualise the trends across different months.

   ### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
   The graph below shows the analysis of theater outcomes based on launch date.

   In this section, the play subcategory campaign goals will be categorised in dollars and grouped from amounts less than $1000 to amounts more than $50000. The outcomes of these different amount ranges will be analysed and grouped firstly by counting the number of successful, failed and cancelled projects and finally calculating the percentage of successful, failed and cancelled outcones. Hence, we will be able to predict suitable and best goal amounts for future campaigns.

   ### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
   + Date conversion had to be done in order to do proper analysis using the Timestamp Coverter Tool online in the link here [epoch converter] https://www.epochconverter.com/

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
   + The month of May recorded the highest number of succssful campaigns and it will be best to launch a campaign in May

   + The highest number of failed campaigns were recorded in the month of October. Hence, it won't be a good idea to launch campaigns in October.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
   + There was a 76% success rate recorded for goal values less than $1000 and least success rate for goal values between $45000 to 49999. Thus, it is best to focus more on campaign goals less than 1000 for best results.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
