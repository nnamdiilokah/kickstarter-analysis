# Kickstarter Analysis
Performing Analysis on Kickstarter Data

  ## Overview of Project
  The purpose of this project is to analyse, visualise and elaborate the performance of Louise's different fund raising campaigns with respect to their lunch dates and campaign goals. Excel pivot tables and pivot graphs will be used to carry out this analysis.

  ## Analysis and Challenges
  In this project, we will be carrying out two different analysis for Louise's theater campaign category.
  Firstly, we will analyse the theater outcomes based on launch date between January to December. We will then analyse the theater outcomes based on launch goals, categorised from amounts lessed than $1000 to amounts more than $50000. This analysis is defined below as:
  + Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  + Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
